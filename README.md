# Background
As an FP&A analyst with 8 years of experience, I have recently started developing my data analysis skills, focusing on expanding my proficiency in SQL. While practicing SQL, I became curious about the job market for data analyst positions, particularly remote roles, as I plan to travel. 

### Here are the questions I wanted to answer through my queries

1. Which remote data analyst roles offer the highest salaries?

2. What are the highest-paying skills for data analysts?

3. Which skills are most in-demand for data analyst positions?

4. What are the specific skills linked to the highest-paying data analyst roles?

5. What is the optimal combination of skills for remote data analysts?


# Tools I Used
- **SQL**: All the analysis was performed using SQL to query a dataset of job postings.
- **VS Code**: Used for coding and testing the SQL queries.
- **PostgreSQL**: The database engine where the data was hosted and queried.
- **GitHub**: Used for version control and hosting this project, including the SQL queries and results.


# The Analysis
The analysis was performed in five steps:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
   - A query was used to identify the top 10 highest-paying data analyst jobs. The results were filtered to only include remote jobs and sorted by the average yearly salary.

   ``` sql
   SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```
Hereâ€™s a more general breakdown of the top-paying data analyst jobs:

- **Wide Salary Range**: Salaries for remote data analyst roles vary significantly, ranging from **$184,000** to **$650,000** annually, highlighting a broad spectrum of compensation in the field.

        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
```

Here are the insights from the skills column of the top 10 data analyst roles:

- **SQL** appears 8 times, making it the most frequently mentioned skill.

INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE   
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY 
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5
```
